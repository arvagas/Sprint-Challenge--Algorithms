#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) `O(n)`: The loop is running linearly. Will run based on n variable


b) `O(n log n)`: The while loop is running at O(n). However the outer for loop has a higher time complexity.


c) `O(n)`: This is a basic recursive function that runs based on the number passed.
